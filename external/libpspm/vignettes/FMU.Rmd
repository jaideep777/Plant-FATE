## Discretizing the PDE

The fixed mesh solver relies on to discretizing the McKendrick von-Foerster PDE
$$                                                              \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(g(x,t,E)u(x,t)) - \mu(x,t,E) u(x,t)
$$

A fixed grid (mesh) with $J$ cells is used to discretize the physiological variable $x$. The edges of the gridcells are at $x_j, j \in [0,J]$, and centres are at $X_j = (x_j+x_{j+1})/2, j\in [0,J-1]$. The mesh is created during initialization. Note that $x_0 = x_b, x_J = x_m$. The FMU method solves for the solution $u(x)$ at the cell centres $X_j$.

Integrating the PDE over a grid cell $j$, we get

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}} u(x,t)dx = -[g(x,t,E)u(x,t)]_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}} -  \int_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}} \mu(x,t,E)u(x,t)dx
$$

Lets us define the average value of $u(x)$ over the cell $j$ as $U_j$. Therefore, 
$$
h_j U_j = \int_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}} u(x,t)dx
$$
where $h_j$ is the width of the cell, $h_j=x_{j+1}-x_{j}$.

We also approximate the integral on the RHS and the boundary coundition using midpoint quadrature rule:
$$
\int_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}} \mu(x,t,E)u(x,t)dx = h_j \mu(X_j) U_j
$$

$$
\int_{x_{b}}^{x_{m}} \beta(x,t,E)u(x)dx = \int_{x_{0}}^{x_{J}} \beta(x,t,E)u(x,t)dx = \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} h_j \beta(X_j) U_j
$$

Therefore, we can write,
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} U_j = -\frac{\left[g(x,t,E)u(x,t)\right]_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1}}}{h_j} - \mu(X_j) U_j
$$

which gives us the equation for calculating the required derivatives. 
However, we still need a way to calculate the density function at the cell edges, i.e., $u_j$.

## Calculating the density at cell edges

![](upwind.png){width=10cm}



One possible way to do so is to simply interpolate it from the values of $U$ from the neigbouring cells. For example, to get $u_3$, one could use
$$
u_3 = U_2 + \frac{(U_3-U_2)}{(X_3-X_2)}(x_3-X_2)
$$

However, this solution is **unstable**.

### The upwind scheme 

The most stable way to get the density at the cell edges is to use the upwind differencing scheme. In the first order upwind scheme, the value of $u$ is assumed to be constant throughout the grid cell, thus giving
$$
u^{o1}_3 = U_2.
$$

While this method is stable, it has very low accuracy. 

The second order upwind scheme assumes linear variation in $u$ within a grid cell. Thus, we can again find $u_3$ by linear interpolation, but this time, extrapolating it from the upwind values of $U$,

$$
u^{o2}_3 = U_2 + \Delta U (x_3-X_2)
$$
where 
$$
\Delta U = \frac{(U_2-U_1)}{(X_2-X_1)}
$$

This method is accurate, but again, can become unstable if the slope $\Delta U$ is too high. 

To obtain the best of both worlds, i.e., the stability of the first order method and the accuracy of the second order method, we can combine the two solutions as follows,

$$
u_3 = u^{o1}_3 + \phi \cdot (u^{o2}_3-u^{o1}_3)
$$

where $\phi$ is a scalar between 0 and 1. When $\phi=0$, $u_3$ is obtained from the first order scheme, and when $\phi=1$, from the second order scheme. 

### Flux limiter

The value of $\phi$ can be obtained as a function of the ratio $r$ of successive slopes of the density function:
$$
r = \Delta U_\text{downwind} / \Delta U_\text{upwind}
$$

where, e.g., 
$$
\Delta U_\text{3,downwind} = \frac{U_3-U_2}{X_3-X_2}
$$
and

$$
\Delta U_\text{3,upwind} = \frac{U_2-U_1}{X_2-X_1}
$$

When the upwind slope is too high compared to the downwind slope ($r \to 0$), the second order scheme will give a very high (undesirable) value of $u_3$. In such a case, we want the first order scheme, and thus $\phi \approx 0$.

When the upwind slope is too small compared to the downwind slope, the second order approximation of $u_3$ will be too close to the first order approximation, and we can improve accuracy by pusing it up even more ($\phi > 1$). 

All these features are achieved by the Superbee flux limiter,
$$
\phi(r) =  \max(\max(0.0,\min(2r,1)),\min(r,2))
$$

```{r}
x = seq(0,4,length.out = 1000)
y = sapply(X = x, FUN = function(r){max(max(0.0,min(2*r,1.0)),min(r,2.0))} )
plot(y~x, type="l", xlab="r", ylab = "phi(r)")
```

**Note: In all textbooks I have seen, r is defined as $\Delta U_{up}/\Delta U_{down}$. That doesnt make sense, and also doesnt work numerically. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something?**

Thus, the final scheme is:

$$
u_i = U_{i-1} + \phi(r)\frac{(U_{i-1}-U_{i-2})}{(X_{i-1}-X_{i-2})}(x_i-X_{i-1}),
$$
$$
r = \Delta U_\text{downwind} / \Delta U_\text{upwind}
$$ 
$$
\Delta U_\text{downwind} = \frac{U_i-U_{i-1}}{X_{i}-X_{i-1}}
$$ 
$$
\Delta U_\text{upwind} = \frac{U_{i-1}-U_{i-2}}{X_{i-1}-X_{i-2}}
$$

<!-- Further, since $X_i=(x_i+x_{i+1})/2$, $x_i-X_{i-1}=(x_i-x_{i-1})/2$, and $X_i-X_{i-1}=(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1})/2$, giving -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- u_i = U_{i-1} + \phi(r)\frac{(U_{i-1}-U_{i-2})}{(x_{i}-x_{i-2})}(x_i-x_{i-1}),\\ -->
<!-- r = \Delta U_\text{downwind} / \Delta U_\text{upwind} \\  -->
<!-- \Delta U_\text{downwind} = \frac{U_i-U_{i-1}}{x_{i+1}-x_{i-1}} \\ -->
<!-- \Delta U_\text{upwind} = \frac{U_{i-1}-U_{i-2}}{x_{i}-x_{i-2}} \\ -->
<!-- $$ -->

### $u_1, u_{J-1}, u_{J}$

Finally, the we also need to find the values of $u_1$, $u_{J-1}$, and $u_{J}$, which cannot be found by the above formula due to out-of-bounds subscripts. We simply use the first order scheme to get these:
$$
u_i = U_{i-1}
$$

### Boundary condition

$u_0$ is obtained from the boundary condition:

$$
u_0 = \frac{s_\text{e}}{g(x_0)} \int_{x_{0}}^{x_{J}} \beta(x)u(x)dx = \frac{s_\text{e}}{g(x_0)} \sum_{j=0}^{J-1} h_j \beta(X_j) U_j
$$
